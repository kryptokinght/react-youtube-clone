# React Youtube Clone
It is a clone of the youtube search page in the most basic and clean form that shows instant results as you type in the search box. It shows only the top 10 results. The site is live at [React-youtube-clone](https://elastic-varahamihira-5addb9.netlify.com/).

### Getting Started

Clone this repo and then type the following commands to get the site running instantly. It makes use of the *webpack-dev-server* package to run a development server in your browser.
The code uses the Youtube API key which is exported from api_keys/keys.js . This folder has not been commited so make sure to add your own API key in a similar named file.

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
Navigate to ***localhost:8080*** to see the site live.
